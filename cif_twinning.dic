# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## IDB 2013-06-27
## To see the confusion associated with 
## the current version of the refln_twin loop,
## compare this example with the example given under _refln_twin 
## In the example here each datum occurs once in the refln_twin loop 
## and correctly gives the Fobs and Fcalc asociated with this datum, 
## but the other twins components are never mentioned 
## and in the case of merohedral twinning never need to be mentioned.  
##
## In the example given in the reflns_twin catagory, 
## each datum is given as many times as there are twins that contribute to it, 
## and for each of these the (identical) values of Fobs and Fcalc 
## are repeated which is an unnecessary duplication.  
## Further the value given for Fcalc contains the contributions 
## of ALL the twins to that datum, not just the contribution 
## of the twin whose _*_indivdual_id appears on the same line. 
## The problem is, that as given in version 0.3, refln_twin 
## is trying to perform two separate functions, and does neither well.
##
## The solution to this problem is to split refln_twin two loops, 
## one (refln_twin) uses _*_datum_id as the list reference and 
## gives Fobs, Fcalc etc. for that datum.  
## It optionally permits the listing of h,k,l for one (but only one) 
## of the twins by way of identification.
## It is necessay to keep _refln_twin_individual_id in the refln_twin loop 
## because in the case of non-merohedral twinning not all datum points 
## (observed diffraction peaks) can be indexed to the reference twin, 
## some must be indexed to other twin components.
##
## The second loop (twin_contribution) uses the _*_twin_id 
## and the corresponding h,k,l as the list reference.
## It shows to which datum point each of the twin reflections contibutes.  
## I have added a twin_contribution loop to this example 
## (though as I am not familiar with twins I don't know if the item values 
## I have given make any sense - they illustrate the structure 
## but should be replaced by a proper example).
##
## In all loops in which _*_individual_id or _*_twin_id appears, 
## the h,k,l indices are those that belong to the identified twin.
##
## JRH/VGY: we have adopted this suggestion and edited the loops
## accordingly.

    _example_detail
;
 The twinning example presented above shows twinning by merohedry for
 a trigonal crystal system. The simulated space group is P 32 2 1, but
 the true space group is P 32. The twin operation chosen is 2: x,x,0 in
 P 32 2 1 corresponding to operation (by rows) 0, 1, 0 / 1, 0, 0 / 0, 0, -1
 (see table 11.2.2.1 of IT Vol A).

 The twin_contribution loop shows which reflection from which twin 
 contributes to the diffraction peak identified by 
 _twin_contribution_datum_id.

 The refln_twin loop gives the properties of each diffraction peak
 (identified by _refln_twin_datum_id) which is indexed 
 to one of the twin individuals.
 Because this is an example of merohedral twinning, 
 all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the reference twin 
 (_refln_twin_individual_id = 1).  
 In cases of non-merohdral twinning some diffraction peaks 
 would have to be indexed to different twin individuals.  

 In each of the loops shown in this example the first item(s) on a line 
 is(are) the list reference.  While the list reference must be present 
 in every loop, it may be placed at any point on the line.

## This depends upon which aspect of the category is most important:
## the fact that it refers to twinning, or the fact that it provides

     _refln_twin_datum_id is the list reference and serves

     _refln_twin_datum_id include the contributions from all the twins.  
     The diffraction peak is optionally indexed by 
     _refln_twin_index_h, _*_k and _*_l for the this reflection 
     contributed by the twin component _refln_twin_individual_id.  
     Only one such indexing is allowed, the choice of which 
     to include is arbitrary.

        _refln_twin_F_squared_calc =

              = osf*Sum{mass_fraction*_refln_F_squared_calc}

         to this diffraction peak.
