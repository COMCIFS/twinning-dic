    2012-07-25 Created from Victor Young's draft text. JRH

    2012-08-21 cosmetic changes such as arranging the items 
               alphabetically and added queries for VY. I.D.Brown
    2012-08-28 Inserted changes from V. Young as per I.D. Brown's
               comments; removed _example_detail for twin category; corrected

    2013-03-13 Added missing _twin_refln_index_ . JRH
    2013-03-25 IDB: Added enumeration range to 
               _twin_individual__mass_fraction_refined and rewrote 
               the definition

    2013-07-11 JRH edited examples to reflect proposed changes from IDB
    2013-07-29 VGY modified examples to comply with IDB's suggested changes 
               (see below). These are within comments, but not yet integrated
               into the text of the document. Added nmt for non-merohedral
               twin into data_twin_lattice_type. Somehow this was removed.
    2013-08-16 VGY made corrections as directed by JH in examples 2 and 3. 
               Removed work for these examples from commented text and 
               integrated into document. Updated example 1 to include explicit 
               _twin_contribution items for individual 2.
    2013-09-02 JRH edited in latest examples from VGY after email discussion               
    2013-09-03 JRH: move lattice_twin_type into twin_individual category; add

               coming from different individuals.
    2013-09-13 IDB: Changed _refln_twin to _twin_refln, 
               improved the wording of some definitions, corrected syntax errors, 
               added _twin_refln_include_status, 
               removed '_mandatory yes' from _twin_refln_index_
               Rearranged the order of items in some examples to put the 
               list reference first.
    2013-11-13 IDB: Following comments from Tony Linden and George Sheldrick 
               an alternative version of twin_refln is proposed.  
               If this is adopted _twin_contribution would be dropped.
    2013-12-04 IDB: The alternative twin_refln is adopted and 
               twin_contribution is deleted.
    2013-12-04 MINOR corrections made by VGY with respect to line number:
               line 176 - spelling of "International" corrected. Also the next
                    short paragraph explaining twin_contribution was removed.
               lines 391-392 swapped.
               lines 411-415 clarified the description of the four-individual

    _example_detail
;
 The twinning example presented above shows twinning by merohedry for
 a trigonal crystal system. The simulated space group is P 32 2 1, but
 the true space group is P 32. The twin operation chosen is 2: x,x,0 in
 P 32 2 1 corresponding to operation (by rows) 0, 1, 0 / 1, 0, 0 / 0, 0, -1
 (see table 11.2.2.1 of International Tables for Crystallography Vol A).

 The twin_refln loop gives the properties of each diffraction peak
 (identified by _twin_refln_datum_id) which is indexed 
 to one of the twin individuals.
 Because this is an example of merohedral twinning, 
 all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the reference twin 
 (_twin_refln_individual_id = 1).  
 In cases of non-merohdral twinning some diffraction peaks 
 would have to be indexed to different twin individuals.  

 In each of the loops shown in this example the first item(s) on a line 
 is(are) the list reference.  While the list reference must be present 
 in every loop, it may be placed at any point on the line.

    The calculated F^2 for an observed peak is a weighted sum 
    of the contribution of all the twin components.

# Description of Example 1
;
   This partial listing describes seven observed diffraction peaks 
   in a four-individual twin by non-merohedry. The reference individual
   is 1. Reflections from the other three individuals 2,3, and 4 are 
   present only if these cannot be experimentally separated from the 
   reference individual.

 This example is taken from Colombo, et. al, (2000) 
 Inorg. Chem. 39, 4621. 
 Two structures of nitronium tetranitratogallate
 are reported as a result of an enantiotropic phase transition. 
 The higher temperature phase is in the tetragonal space group I-4, 
 while the lower temperature phase is a twin by non-merohedry 
 in space group I2. 
 The individuals are enantiomorphic as a result of the phase transition. 
 In the listing above it is clear that datums 620 - 624 do not contain 
 overlapping reflections, whereas datums 625 - 629 contain contributions 
 from both twins.

     This item serves to identify an observed diffraction peak. 
     It may include contributions from one or more twin components
     and so may appear more than once in the list.  
     The values of _twin_refln_F_squared_calc and 
     _twin_refln_F_squared_meas indexed by
     _twin_refln_datum_id include the contributions from all the twins.  
     The diffraction peak is indexed by 
     _twin_refln_index_h, _*_k and _*_l referred to the cell of 
     the twin component identified by given by_twin_refln_individual_id.  
     
     The list reference includes both _twin_refln_datum_id and 
     _twin_refln_indivdual_id.  The combination of these two items 
     may only appear once in a list.

        Calculated value for the overall squared structure factors (in
        electrons squared for X-ray diffraction) arising from all 
        the twin contributions to the peak defined by _twin_refln_datum_id.  
        The total contribution from all twins to a single observed
        reflection is modelled according to the method of Pratt, Coyle
        and Ibers (1971, J. Chem. Soc. A, 2146) as follows:

        _twin_refln_F_squared_calc =

              = osf*Sum{mass_fraction*_refln_F_squared_calc}

         Where osf is the overall scale factor 
         and the sum is taken over all the twin components that contribute
         to this diffraction peak.
